# PRODUCT NAME
COLEBRO (Content-based Lecture Browsing)

# MOTIVATION
With the rapid spread of the Internet, lecturing over the Internet has become very popular.
Users can access these videos through tags and titles. However, the tags and topics that are 
placed on most videos do not cover all topics covered in the videos.
My aim is to tag more comprehensive videos and give the user the ability to search by the
content of the video.

# GENERAL INFO
Users who upload lecture videos to the internet put either a title or several tags on the their lecture videos. 
However, the title and tags are about the general subject of the lecture videos.
In this project, when users upload lecture videos, audio and image analysis studies are applied to lecture videos.
And so all the audios and texts in the lecture videos are save to in the database.
When users search the lecture videos using the search bar, the search is performed through audios and texts files in the database.
